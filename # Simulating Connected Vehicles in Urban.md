# Simulating Connected Vehicles in Urban Networks with Cooperative Lane-Changing and Signal Priority using SUMO & Python

🚦 A hands-on simulation project exploring how Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and real-time Signal Priority can improve urban mobility and reduce congestion. Built using **SUMO**, **Python**, and **TraCI**, this project is part of a 10-week learning journey into Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Smart Mobility.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Urban traffic congestion, emissions, and signal delays are persistent challenges in modern cities. This project investigates how **Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)** communication and **cooperative driving behavior** can enhance traffic flow using traffic simulation.

🔍 The goal is to:
- Simulate connected vehicles that **communicate** and **cooperate** at intersections.
- Implement **signal priority** systems that adapt in real-time to traffic conditions.
- Measure the effect of CAV behaviors on **traffic delay**, **queue lengths**, and **emissions**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives (Week 0–10)

- ✅ Understand the foundations of **CAVs**, **V2I communication**, and **signal priority**.
- ✅ Learn and apply **SUMO**, **TraCI**, and **Python scripting** for traffic simulation.
- ✅ Build and version a modular simulation project with **Git** and **GitHub**.
- ✅ Share weekly progress, lessons, and challenges as part of a public learning journey.
